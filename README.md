# üå± chia - Check It All

`chia` is a command line tool that lets you run some checks.
It can be easily integrated into your CI process.

## üïπ Usage

You can run `chia` in your terminal, but keep in mind to also install all **required dependencies**.
Otherwise, the check might fail!
```bash
# detect language and run all available tests
chia

# specify a config for chia (local/remote)
chia --config /PATH/TO/.chia.yml
chia --config https://PATH/TO/.chia.yml

# only detect and return the language of the project
chia --language-detection
```

Instead of keeping track of your dependencies, you can use our [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/worldiety/chia).
It contains all the required binaries and is ready to use:
```bash
# run docker container with all dependencies and mount the current folder for analysis
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/project worldiety/chia:latest
```

You can also add this to your [GitLab CI config](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/) ...
```yml
...

stages:
  - lint
  - build
  - deploy

chia:
  stage: lint
  image: worldiety/chia:latest
  allow_failure: false
  script:
    - chia

...
```

... or use our [:octocat: Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-chia).

If a check is missing, the [`CheckProvider`](https://github.com/worldiety/chia/blob/master/Sources/chiaLib/Internal/CheckProvider.swift) is the right places to start.
Just add another implemention and have a look at all the [other checks](https://github.com/worldiety/chia/tree/master/Sources/chiaLib/Internal/CheckProviders).

If your favorite programming language is missing, have a look at the [`Language`](https://github.com/worldiety/chia/blob/master/Sources/chiaLib/API/Language.swift).
